# React Project - Punk API

## Overview
Your task is to build a website using React based on the specifications outline below. This will be based on
the Punk API which contains all the data you will need for the task (there is also a link to a data file which we
recommend you use before diving straight into using the API). Please refer to Earworm as well as the
sandbox apps we built together during the module! 
You will have to use all of the skills you have gained over the course of the module to complete this
challenge.

## Requirements
1.  Built entirely in React
2.  Repository on GitHub
3.  Use the Punk API (after using the data file first) (https://punkapi.com/)
4.  Test where possible (RTL)
   
## Plan

Start - All the wireframe content in black is the first part of the challenge - that is, the sidenav, the main
section containing the beers and beer cards for each piece of data. The component tree is below to help you
get started.  

1 - Once you've got the design and layout sorted to render the elements, it's time to add some search
functionality. Make it so you can search the beers by their name, and the page content should update as you
type each letter in the box. 

2 - Finally attempt to make it so you can filter the content on three conditions:
High Alcohol (ABV value greater than 6%)
Classic Range (Was first brewed before 2010)
High Acidity (pH lower than 4) 

3 - Style the website however you see fit! Go wild!
